## Tech Stack
- React Native / Expo
- TypeScript
- NativeWind (TailwindCSS)
- Supabase (Auth & Database)
- OpenAI Vision API
- i18n-js (Internationalization)

## Development Setup

### EAS Build Configuration
This project is configured with EAS Build for iOS development and testing on physical devices.

#### Prerequisites
- Expo CLI and EAS CLI installed globally
- Apple Developer account with valid certificates
- iPhone registered for development

#### Build Profiles
- **development**: For testing on registered devices with development client
- **preview**: Internal distribution builds  
- **production**: App Store release builds

#### Building for iPhone
```bash
# Build development version for testing
eas build --platform ios --profile development

# Build preview version
eas build --platform ios --profile preview
```

#### Development Workflow
```bash
# Start development server
npx expo start

# Install new dependencies safely
pnpm install

# Add package that needs build scripts
pnpm add --allow-build=package-name
```

### Package Management (pnpm)
This project uses pnpm with enhanced security via `onlyBuiltDependencies`:

```json
{
  "pnpm": {
    "onlyBuiltDependencies": [
      "react-native-elements",
      "unrs-resolver"
    ]
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- üõ°Ô∏è Prevents build failures from surprise install scripts
- üéØ Only whitelisted packages can run install/postinstall scripts
- üîí Safer EAS cloud builds by blocking unknown scripts

**Adding New Dependencies:**
- Most packages: `pnpm add package-name` (scripts blocked by default)
- Packages needing scripts: `pnpm add --allow-build=package-name`
- Or manually add to `onlyBuiltDependencies` array in package.json

### Environment Variables
The app requires these environment variables for full functionality:

- `EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY` - OpenAI API key for food analysis
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` - Supabase project URL  
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Supabase anonymous key
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID` - Google OAuth web client
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_IOS_CLIENT_ID` - Google OAuth iOS client

For EAS builds, set sensitive variables via:
```bash
# Required: Set OpenAI API key as EAS secret (not in eas.json for security)
eas secret:create --name EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY --value your_key_here

# Other secrets can also be set this way for production
eas secret:create --name EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY --value your_key_here
```
